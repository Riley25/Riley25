### Hello :raising_hand_man: 

My name is Riley, and I have Masterâ€™s in Financial Engineering from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/). I'm from Green Bay, Wisconsin. Home of the cheese heads!  :cheese: :football: :snowflake:	

I program in Python, C++ , R and SQL. My favorite projects and assignments are:

- [Pricing and Hedging](https://github.com/Riley25/FE-620) (*R programming*)

In my freetime, I enjoy:

- :telescope: stargazing & looking at the planets with my telescope

- :open_book: reading [Fisher Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Finance](Book-Fisher_Black_and_the_Revolutionary_Idea_of_Finance.jpg)

I'm curious about:
