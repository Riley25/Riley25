### Hello :raising_hand_man: 

My name is Riley, and I have Masterâ€™s in Financial Engineering from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://https://www.stevens.edu/). I'm also from Green Bay, Wisconsin. Home of the cheese heads!  :cheese: :football: 

I program in Python, C++ and R. Some of my favorite projects and assignments are below: 



In my freetime, I enjoy:

- :telescope: stargazing & looking at the planets with my telescope

- :open_book: reading [Fisher Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Finance](Book-Fisher_Black_and_the_Revolutionary_Idea_of_Finance.jpg)

- :film_projector: watching [Another Life](https://www.netflix.com/title/80236236)

I'm curious about:
